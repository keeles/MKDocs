# Our updated version of the EJS Documentation

During a project in the first semester of our FSWD program at BCIT, we were instructed to use EJS for one of our term projects. We were not given any instruction by our teacher about how to use EJS, or any starter code that contained EJS files for this assignment. He told us it was important to learn how to read technical documentation, and we should all be able to figure it out from what we could find on the [EJS Site](https://ejs.co/).

Our main issue with the EJS documentation was the lack of a clear example's in each section. They show small snippets of code, but for a first semester student it was not obvious where these snippets of code should be used. We agreed that in order to improve on the documentation they already had, we needed a much clearer step-by-step process, and more images to create a more complete picture for someone who had never seen, used or even heard of EJS before.

The official EJS documentation makes many assumptions about what the reader already knows, but they are not clear about what these assumptions are. We make it very clear what we are expecting a reader to already know, and direct them to the resources they need to ensure they have an adequate understanding of these prerequisites.

We included a step-by-step set up tutorial of how to set up EJS with express, a complete breakdown of all the tags, a troubleshooting guide, and a glossary page for first-time EJS user!
