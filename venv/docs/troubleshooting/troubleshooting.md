#Introduction
This report provides a systematic approach to diagnose and troubleshoot common issues encountered when working with EJS templates in a web application.

##Common Issues

1\. **Template Not Found**

Symptoms: Error: Could not find the include file
Potential Causes:

Incorrect path to the EJS file.

File name typo or wrong file extension.

**Resolution Steps:**

Verify the path and file name in the include statement. Check that the file exists in the specified directory.

2\. Syntax Errors in EJS
Symptoms: Syntax-related error messages such as SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list.
Potential Causes:
Typos or errors in EJS tags.
Incorrect JavaScript syntax within EJS tags.
Resolution Steps:
Carefully review the EJS syntax in the template.
Ensure all opening <% tags have corresponding closing %> tags.

3\. Data Not Rendered
Symptoms: Variables not displaying data or rendering as undefined.
Potential Causes:
Data not passed correctly to the template.
Variables are not properly referenced in the EJS tags.
Resolution Steps:
Double-check the data passed into the render function.
Ensure variables are correctly referenced using <%= variableName %> syntax.

4\. EJS Compilation Errors
Symptoms: Errors related to EJS compilation such as Unexpected token.
Potential Causes:
JavaScript expressions in EJS tags are incorrect.
Closing tags might be missing for control structures (if, for, etc.).
Resolution Steps:
Look for any typos or syntax errors within scriptlet tags <% %>.

5\. Performance Issues
Symptoms: Slow rendering of EJS templates.
Potential Causes:
Complex logic within the templates.
Large datasets being processed in the template.
Resolution Steps:
Move complex logic to server-side scripts before rendering.
Limit the amount of data passed to the template and use pagination.

6\. EJS Layout Issues
Symptoms: Layout components such as headers or footers not appearing correctly.
Potential Causes:
Layout files are not correctly included or referenced.
Incorrect usage of partials or blocks.
Resolution Steps:
Ensure layout files are properly linked with <%- include('layoutFile') %>.

##Tools and Techniques
EJS Lint: Use EJS-Lint to detect syntax errors in EJS templates.
Logging: Implement console logs to trace data flow and template rendering process.
Simplify Templates: Break down complex templates into smaller components.

##Conclusion
EJS is a powerful templating engine that enables dynamic content rendering on web pages. However, like any technology, it can encounter issues that require systematic troubleshooting. By following the steps outlined in this report, developers can identify and resolve common EJS issues effectively.
