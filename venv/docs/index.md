# Introduction to EJS

Welcome to the fascinating world of EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates), where the dynamic power of JavaScript meets the simplicity of HTML templates! Whether you're crafting a small project or architecting a large application, EJS offers a flexible and intuitive way to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

EJS is all about efficiency and ease. It lets you insert JavaScript values into your HTML and use JavaScript to iterate over data, conditionally display content, and include reusable templates. But what truly makes EJS shine is its customizable nature, brought to life through a wide array of options.
