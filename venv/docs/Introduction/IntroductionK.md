# Introduction to EJS

EJS is a templating language that allows you to dynamically render HTML with Javascript on your website to customize your user's experience. It is commonly used with an Express server, something we will cover thoroughly in this documentation as we highly recommend this approach for first time users.

This documentation will walk you through the [syntax](../Getting%20Started/getStartedA.md), [features](../Features/Features-c.md), [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md), and an example of use with an [Express server](../Express/expressK.md).
